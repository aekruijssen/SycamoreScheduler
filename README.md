Final Course Team Project for CSCI 201 - Principles of Software Development

I and my team developed a course plan web app with web sockets & multithreading to enable real-time collaborative editing. We coded a Python web scraper to collect course data from USC site, which we stored in SQL database along with user account data (saved major, class history, friends they follow, etc). I implemented web sockets and multi-threading to enable real-time collaborative editing. Through this project, I learned proper software development methodologies, source/version control with Git, and documentation, as well as how to effectively work on a big software project with a team from start to finish.

TLDR;
- Python web scraper collected course data from USC site
- Stored in SQL database along with user account data (saved major, class history, friends they follow)
- My role was implementing web sockets and multi-threading to enable real-time collaborative editing (similar to Google Docs)
