Final Course Team Project for CSCI 201 - Principles of Software Development

Course plan web app team project. Coded a Python web scraper to collect course data from USC site, which we stored in SQL database along with user account data (saved major, class history, friends they follow). I implemented web sockets and multi-threading to enable real-time collaborative editing (similar to Google Docs)
